    <h1>Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" target="_blank">MMJ</a>)</h1>
    <p>Cannabis and cannabinoids that are prescribed by physicians for their patients. Preliminary evidence suggests
        that cannabis can reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS,
        reduces chronic pain and muscle spasms and treats severe forms of epilepsy. The Cannabis plant has a history of
        medicinal use dating back thousands of years in many cultures.</p>

        <h2>Medical uses</h2>
        <p>Overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear
            whether it is a useful treatment for any condition, or whether harms outweight any benefit. There is no
            consistent
            evidence that it helps with chronic pain and muscle spasms. Low quality evidence suggests its use for
            reducing nausea
            during chemotherapy, improving appetite in HIV/AIDS, improving sleep, and improving tics in Tourette
            syndrome. When usual treatments are ineffective, cannabinoids have also been recommended for anorexia,
            arthritis,
            glaucoma, and migraine. It is unclear whether American states might be able to mitigate the adverse effects
            of the opioid epidemic by prescribing medical cannabis as an alternative pain management drug.</p>

            <li><h3>"Nausea and vomiting"</h3>
                <p>Overall research into the health effects of medical cannabis has been of low quality and it is not clear
                    whether it is a useful treatment for any condition, or whether harms outweight any benefit. There is no

                    syndrome. When usual treatments are ineffective, cannabinoids have also been recommended for anorexia,

            </li>
            <li><h3>Pain</h3>
                <p>Research into the use of cannabis for treating chronic pain has yielded inconsistent results for
                    neuropathic
                    pain, spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and pain from rheumatic disorders. Cannabis is not
                    effective
                    at treating chronic cancer pain. When cannabis is inhaled to relieve pain, blood levels of cannabinoids
                    rise
                    faster than when oral products
                    are used, peaking within three minutes and attaining an analgesic effect in seven minutes. A 2011 review
                    considered cannabis to be generally safe,[30] and it appears safer than opioids in palliative
                    care.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Neurological conditions</h3>
                <p>Cannabis' efficacy is not clear in treating neurological problems, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and
                    movement problems.[16] Evidence also suggests that oral cannabis extract is effective for reducing
                    patient-centered measures of spasticity.[16] A trial of cannabis is deemed to be a reasonable option if
                    other treatments have not been effective.[4][by whom?] Its use for MS is approved in ten
                    countries.[4][32][conflicted source?] A 2012 review found no problems with tolerance, abuse, or
                    addiction.[33] In the United States, cannabidiol, one of the cannabinoids found in the marijuana plant,
                    has been approved for treating two severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet
                    syndrome.[7]</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Adverse effects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Medical use</h3>
                <p>There is insufficient data to draw strong conclusions about the safety of medical cannabis.[35]
                    Typically,
                    adverse effects of medical cannabis use are not serious; they include tiredness, dizziness, increased
                    appetite, and cardiovascular and psychoactive effects. Other effects can include impaired short-term
                    memory;
                    impaired motor coordination; altered judgment; and paranoia or psychosis at high doses. Tolerance to
                    these effects develops over a period of days or weeks. The amount of cannabis normally used for
                    medicinal
                    purposes is not believed to cause any permanent cognitive impairment in adults, though long-term
                    treatment
                    in adolescents should be weighed carefully as they are more susceptible to these impairments. Withdrawal
                    symptoms are rarely a problem with controlled medical administration of cannabinoids. The ability to
                    drive
                    vehicles or to operate machinery may be impaired until a tolerance is developed.[22] Although supporters
                    of
                    medical cannabis say that it is safe,[35] further research is required to assess the long-term safety of
                    its
                    use.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Recreational use</h3>
                <p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has low
                    toxicity while the LD50 (dose of THC needed to kill 50% of tested rodents) is high. Acute effects may
                    include anxiety and panic, impaired attention, and memory (while intoxicated), an increased risk of
                    psychotic symptoms, and possibly increased risk of accidents if a person drives a motor vehicle while
                    intoxicated.[38] Psychotic episodes are well-documented and typically resolve within minutes or hours.
                    There have been few reports of symptoms lasting longer. According to the United States
                    Department of Health and Human Services, there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with
                    cannabis use in 2011. These statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition
                    induced by or related to recent cannabis use. The drug use must be "implicated" in the emergency
                    department visit, but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit. Most of the illicit drug
                    emergency room visits involved multiple drugs.[41] In 129,000 cases, cannabis was the only implicated
                    drug.</p>

    <div CLASS="right">
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Cognitive effects</h3>
                <p> 2011 systematic review evaluated published studies of the acute and long-term cognitive effects of
                    cannabis. THC intoxication is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis,
                    including effects on the ability to plan, organize, solve problems, make decisions, and control
                    impulses. The extent of this impact may be greater in novice users, and paradoxically, those habituated
                    to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal. Studies of long-term effects on
                    cognition have provided conflicting results, with some studies finding no difference between long-term
                    abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits. The discrepancies between studies may
                    reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users, and greater duration
                    of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life. A second systematic
                    review focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on
                    brain structure and function.[60] A 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects
                    were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory.</p>

        <h2>Pharmacology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The genus Cannabis contains two species which produce useful amounts of psychoactive cannabinoids: Cannabis
                indica and Cannabis sativa, which are listed as Schedule I medicinal plants in the US; a third species,
                Cannabis ruderalis, has few psychogenic properties. Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds;[8] at
                least 80 of these are cannabinoids – chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in
                the brain. As of 2012, more than 20 cannabinoids were being studied by the U.S. FDA.</li>
            <li><h3>Absorption</h3>
                <p>
                    Cannabinoid absorption is dependent on its route of administration.
                    Inhaled and vaporized THC have similar absorption profiles to smoked THC, with a bioavailability ranging
                    from 10 to 35%. Oral administration has the lowest bioavailability of approximately 6%, variable
                    absorption depending on the vehicle used, and the longest time to peak plasma levels (2 to 6 hours)
                    compared to smoked or vaporized THC. Similar to THC, CBD has poor oral bioavailability, approximately
                    6%. The low bioavailability is largely
                    attributed to significant first-pass metabolism in the liver and erratic absorption from the
                    gastrointestinal tract. However, oral administration of CBD has a faster time to peak concentrations (2
                    hours) than THC. Due to the poor bioavailability of oral preparations, alternative routes of
                    administration have been
                    studied, including sublingual and rectal. These alternative formulations maximize bioavailability and
                    reduce first-pass metabolism. Sublingual administration in rabbits yielded bioavailability of 16% and
                    time to peak concentration of 4 hours.[73] Rectal administration in monkeys doubled bioavailability to
                    13.5% and achieved peak blood concentrations within 1 to 8 hours after administration.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Distribution</h3>
                <p>
                    Like cannabinoid absorption, distribution is also dependent on route of administration. Smoking and
                    inhalation of vaporized cannabis have better absorption than do other routes of administration, and
                    therefore also have more predictable distribution. THC is highly protein bound once absorbed,
                    with only 3% found unbound in the plasma. It distributes rapidly to highly vascularized organs such as
                    the heart, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, as well as to various glands. Low levels can be detected
                    in the brain, testes, and unborn fetuses, all of which are protected from systemic circulation via
                    barriers.[76] THC further distributes into fatty tissues a few days after administration due to its high
                    lipophilicity, and is found deposited in the spleen and fat after redistribution.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Excretion</h3>
                <p>Due to substantial metabolism of THC and CBD, their metabolites are excreted mostly via feces, rather
                    than by urine. After delta-9-THC is hydroxylated into 11-OH-THC via CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4,
                    it undergoes phase II metabolism into more than 30 metabolites, a majority of which are products of
                    glucuronidation. Approximately 65% of THC is excreted in feces and 25% in the urine, while the remaining
                    10% is excreted by other means. The terminal half-life of THC is 25 to 36 hours,[83] whereas for CBD
                    it is 18 to 32 hours. CBD is hydroxylated by P450 liver enzymes into 7-OH-CBD. Its metabolites are
                    products of primarily
                    CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 activity, with potential activity of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6.[84] Similar
                    to delta-9-THC, a majority of CBD is excreted in feces and some in the urine. The terminal half-life
                    is approximately 18–32 hours.

    <h2>Legal status</h2>
    <div class="map"><img src="Images/570px-Map-of-world-medical-cannabis-laws.svg.png"></div>
    <p>Countries that have legalized the medical use of cannabis include Australia,Brazil, Canada,
        Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany,
        Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Lebanon, Luxembourg,]North Macedonia, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru,
        Poland,Portugal, Sri Lanka,
        Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Other countries have more restrictive laws that allow
        only the use of isolated cannabinoid drugs such as Sativex or Epidiolex. Countries with the most
        relaxed policies include Canada, Uruguay, and the Netherlands, where cannabis can be purchased
        without need for a prescription. In Mexico, THC content of medical cannabis is limited to one percent.[132] The
        same limit applies in Switzerland, but no prescription is required to purchase. In the United States, the
        legality of medical cannabis varies by state.
        Cannabis is in Schedule IV of the United Nations' Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, making it subject to
        special restrictions. Article 2 provides for the following, in reference to Schedule IV drugs:
        A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means
        of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade
        in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific
        research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision
        and control of the Party.
        The convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to
        allow use for medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate
        means of protecting health and welfare. The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of
        medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators, manufacturers, and distributors and ensure
        that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required "for medical and scientific
        purposes".</p>
